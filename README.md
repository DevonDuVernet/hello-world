# hello-world
Hello my name is Devon and I am creating this repository as part of an assignment for COMP3521. I am taking COMP3521 as part of my Bachelors in computing science at TRU. My personal interests in computing science are particularly focused on artificial intelligence especially with the recent boom in commercial applications of it. In addition to my studies at TRU I am also finishing up my advanced diploma in Marine Engineering at Georgian College in Ontario where I am learning to be a marine engineer. As part of that training I have spent 7.5 months at sea as an engine cadet (a helper to the engineer and MA's on watch). I live in Ontario with my two children and my partner and enjoy sailing, hiking and watching movies in my free time.
